    <p>Welcome to my personal website! I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Chinese as a Second Language at Peking University. I received my PhD in Second Language Acquisition from the University of Maryland, supervised by Dr. Michael Long (first qualifying paper) and Dr. Robert DeKeyser (second qualifying paper and dissertation). My research focuses on the acquisition and processing of lexical items, particularly multiword units such as idioms, collocations, and lexical bundles.</p>
    <p>In exploring the cognitive mechanism underlying the processing of multiword units, I use a combination of techniques, including behavioral experiments, eye tracking, and EEG. I also incorporate theoretical perspectives from statistical learning, emotion and embodiment, and language prediction to examine this topic.</p>
    <p>I have published research papers in journals such as <em>Studies in Second Language Acquisition</em>, <em>Language Learning</em>, <em>Applied Linguistics</em>, and <em>Applied Psycholinguistics</em>. I also serve as an ad-hoc reviewer for prestigious journals in second language acquisition and applied linguistics. Currently, I am on the editorial board of <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>.</p>
